# exam-extractor

This program allows users to extract exam report data from VCAA exams. Built in is a data cleaner which checks for inconsistencies in the formatting of VCAA exam reports over the years.

It does so by fetching question data as well as report data and ensuring there is a one-to-one correspondence between these.

Within the code there is also an analysis that can be performed on this exam data to form various distributions as well as an experimental 'exam score simulator'.
